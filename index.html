                        <p>The Black Eagles (黒鷲の学級アドラークラッセ Adorākurasse) are one of the three student houses at the Garreg Mach Monastery Officers Academy in Fire Emblem: Three Houses.</p>
                        <p>The Black Eagles house at the Officers Academy is comprised of students who hail from the Adrestian Empire. They favor the use of axes and black magic.</p>
                        <p>The twin-headed eagle of the Adrestian Empire's coat of arms and the black armor worn by Imperial soldiers inspired the name and banner of the Black Eagles.</p>
                        <p>The Black Eagles don't have as many commoners among their ranks, with Dorothea being an exception (Technically speaking, Petra is also a commoner, but according to official lore, she's a princess in her homeland).</p>
