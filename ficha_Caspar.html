                        <p>Caspar is the second-born son of House Bergliez. Randolph and Fleche are the children of his grandfather's favored second wife, and Randolph was initially favored for succession. His grandfather's deteriorating health, however, forced him to retire early in Imperial Year 1168, and Caspar's father inherited the County of Bergliez. At the age of 6, he befriended Linhardt.</p>

                        <p>Due to being lower in the line of succession, Caspar sets off for the Officers Academy in Imperial Year 1180 to make a name for himself through martial ability.</p>

                            <p>After graduating, Caspar becomes an Imperial army general. Should Byleth support Edelgard instead of Rhea (leading to the Crimson Flower route), Caspar will join their cause, where he expresses relief that he made the right decision in doing so, believing that if he stayed in the monastery, he would have to fight his father, who intimidated him.</p>
                            <p>Following the capture of Derdriu and absorption of Alliance lands, Hubert states that Count Bergliez will oversee the newly-acquired lands, prompting Caspar to show surprise and state that Hubert intends to make his father quite busy.</p>
