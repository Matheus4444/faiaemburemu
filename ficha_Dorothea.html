                            <p>Born as a daughter of a lady-in-waiting to Imperial nobles from the Adrestian Empire, Dorothea and her mother were kicked out of the household by her father when she failed to manifest a Crest. Her mother died when she was young, and she lived as a street urchin for some time. She was discovered as a songstress by the Mittelfrank Opera Company in Enbarr in 1171, eventually becoming known as the "Mystical Songstress" three years later. In her support with Hanneman, Dorothea reveals that she met a noble she suspected was her father, based on his testimony that he "threw away" a Crest-less child and the child's maid mother, once she had become a singer. He not only failed to recognize her as his daughter, but tried to flirt with her, much to her disgust</p>
