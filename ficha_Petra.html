                        <p>Petra is the presumptive heir and granddaughter of the king of Brigid, an archipelago to the west of FÃ³dlan. She lost her father at the age of 11 during the Dagda and Brigid War of 1175 to Count Bergliez, Caspar's father, in which Brigid allied with Dagda in a failed invasion of the Adrestian Empire.</p>

                        <p>After Brigid was made a vassal state of the Empire, as a token of their new allegiance, Petra was sent from her homeland by Duke Gerth as an exchange student to the Officers Academy in Imperial Year 1180. She can be recruited by having high Dex and Riding.</p>

                            <p>When Petra and her classmates head to the Holy Tomb, the Imperial Army, led by Metodey, arrives to plunder the Crest Stones. She is shocked when Edelgard reveals herself as the Flame Emperor, as she had used them.</p>
                            <p>If Petra is recruited into the Golden Deer or the Blue Lions, she reveals that she has received a letter from Edelgard but that Brigid plans to stand against the Empire.</p>

                            <p>Should Byleth decide to support Edelgard, Petra will in turn decide to support both of them, despite Edelgard's manipulation in the Holy Tomb. She states that it is ironic that she has chosen to help the Empire, due to the Dagda and Brigid War, but has no regrets in following Byleth. She is assigned to the Black Eagle Strike Force and sent to Garreg Mach in year 1185.</p>
