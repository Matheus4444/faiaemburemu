                            <p>After completing his education, Hubert condemns his father which degrades the Marquisate of Vestra into a mere County. He becomes Count Vestra following his father's assassination and Minister of the Imperial Household sometime after.</p>

                            <p>If Edelgard is sided with after it is revealed that she was the Flame Emperor, in Imperial Year 1185, Hubert assists Edelgard in forming the Black Eagle Strike Force at Garreg Mach. Hubert serves as an adviser to both Edelgard and Byleth, using his tactical prowess to help guide them through battles.</p>
                            <p>Starting their campaign against the Church, Hubert reveals to Byleth and the others that Edelgard has begun purging corrupt nobles in their absence, which also included his father. During the first attack on Garreg Mach, he warns Byleth to dodge an incoming attack from The Immaculate One, but Byleth is hit and is sent into a five-year coma. Hubert, along with the rest of his classmates continue the war against the Church for the next five years, not losing anyone in the process. He and the rest of his classmates are happy to see Byleth again during their reunion.</p>
                            <p>In order to stabilize the three-way war, Hubert suggests they deal with the Alliance first, and the fastest way to reach the capital of Derdriu is to use the Great Bridge of Myrddin. As expected, Alliance forces are guarding the bridge, led by Judith. Hubert advises they deal with her quickly before enemy reinforcements arrive.</p>
                            <p>Following the capture of the bridge, Hubert is pleased to see his classmates' morale has boosted due to Byleth's reemergence, though Edelgard reminds him that his too has also gone up due to their professor returning. As Edelgard and Byleth are discussing about Claude, Hubert comes in and informs the two that he is planning something, as the citizens of Derdriu cannot go and leave as they pleased, warning Byleth not to underestimate him. He also stresses the importance of capturing Derdriu, as several Alliance leaders loathe Claude and if they defeat him, they would be "tripping over themselves" joining the Empire.</p>
                            <p>Claude is defeated during the siege; regardless of the outcome, the Alliance surrenders itself to the Empire. Hubert arranges the transition by having Count Bergliez handle the Alliance's affairs, and the Black Eagles return to the monastery following their victory.</p>
                            <p>As they return to the monastery, Hubert informs Edelgard that her uncle is collecting relics from the Old Alliance, though she allows him to do as he pleases. Hubert also informs Edelgard that not all of the Kingdom stands by the Church, and defeating the Kingdom's most notable Houses would cause the others to fall in line; primarily House Fraldarius, Galatea, Gautier and Charon, and that they have allies inside they could help them.</p>
                            <p>In Hubert's Paralogue, Lord Volkhard informs Hubert that his subordinates were experimenting and caused some Demonic Beasts to break free, and requested him to save his men and put the beasts out of their misery. Hubert and his classmates arrive and save as much of the mages as possible. Though they were ungrateful, they gave them the Arrow of Indra as a reward. Volkhard thanked Hubert for saving his men, though Hubert believed those who slithered in the dark wanted to show them that they were helpless, but their psychological attempt backfired on them.</p>
                            <p>The Church later attempts to recapture Garreg Mach, and Hubert accompanies the rest of his classmates to protect the monastery. Hubert noted that the layout of the Knights was unusual, warning the Professor to watch out for any traps and reinforcements. Following their victory over the Church, Hubert witnessed Randolph's death and gave Edelgard a status report of the battle, commenting on Alois' (if he wasn't recruited) and Seteth's death (if Byleth did not land the finishing blow) in the process.</p>
                            <p>Edelgard moved her forces to capture Arianrhod, where Hubert witnessed Cornelia send her Titanus out to battle; he was impressed by her magical weapons, but regardless, Arianrhod was captured and Cornelia was slain. After Volkhard cryptically stated that he hoped the Empire would not be another Arianrhod, Hubert came in and informed Edelgard that the city was annihilated by javelins of light, causing the death of most of House Rowe's leaders and numerous Imperial forces. He wondered if they had acted too rashly in killing Cornelia, but Edelgard assured him otherwise as they forced those who slithered in the dark to reveal their secret weapon. Edelgard ordered him to keep the full report under wraps, which he immediately complied with by telling the others that the Church was responsible for destroying Arianrhod.</p>
                            <p>Prior to the battle at the Tailtean Plains, Dimitri moved his forces to intercept the Empire, knowing the Knights of Seiros would arrive. Hubert, knowing Dimitri would never battle like this, had anticipated this move and ordered the army to watch out for attacks from the rear and sides. Hubert also witnessed a Kingdom soldier transform into a Demonic Beast, initially believing it to be Thales' work, but quickly realized it was much simpler. Hubert advised Byleth to quickly take out the enemy soldiers before they could transform.</p>
                            <p>As the Empire arrived Fhirdiad, Edelgard ordered the Church to surrender but was given no response. Hubert believed they would not surrender and asked her to begin the attack. Upon hearing the roars of the Immaculate One, Edelgard began the attack on the city, which was lit on fire by the remaining Knights of Seiros. Hubert warned Byleth and the others to avoid the fires and to minimize losses they would have to be flexible on their approach.</p>
                            <p>Rhea was killed in the ensuing battle, finally bringing peace to FÃ³dlan, where Hubert would serve Edelgard as the Minister of the Imperial Household. He would help gather intelligence and assist Edelgard in her silent war against those who slithered in the dark.</p>
