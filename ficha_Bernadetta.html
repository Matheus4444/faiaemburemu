                        <p>Bernadetta is born as the eldest daughter and heir of the son of the Count of Varley. She is extremely shy towards strangers; the only place she feels at ease while far away from home is her room in the dormitory.</p>
                        <p>Bernadetta's reclusive nature is due to extensive trauma she experienced in her childhood at the hands of her own father. Count Varley personally groomed her to become "a perfect wife", subjecting her to grueling training such as tying her to a chair and forcing her to remain quiet and submissive for hours. Bernadetta would dread these sessions, often kicking and screaming to avoid them. She found respite only in her solitude.</p>
                        <p>Her father forbade her from socializing with commoners as he saw them as filth. Bernadetta met a commoner boy, whom she quickly befriended. Her father caught wind of the situation and quickly brought her home. The next day, she received news that the boy had been found by her father's men and was beaten nearly to death, exacerbating her fear of social interaction and of her father.</p>

                            <p>The boy was later revealed to be Yuri, who had been hired by a third party to assassinate Bernadetta due to her Crest of Indech. Yuri acquired a job as an assistant gardener for House Varley, and he befriended her in order to gain her trust. The two played around the gardens, with Bernadetta believing him to be her first true friend. One day, Yuri snuck into her room to assassinate her, but due to the friendship he made, could not bring himself to do so. Count Varley soon burst in and caught him in the treacherous act, having his men beat him to half death. Though she knew that her father hated commoners, he did not reveal to her that her "friend" had tried to assassinate her. She never heard or saw Yuri again, causing her to believe that he had died and that it was her fault.</p>

                        <p>Bernadetta was sent to Garreg Mach Monastery Officers Academy in Imperial Year 1180. In her case, she was essentially kidnapped under her mother's orders and sent to the academy for her safety. She joined the Black Eagles as a result.</p>
                        <p>When not attending lectures, she spends her time hiding in her room getting absorbed in her hobbies.</p>

                            <p>After graduating, Bernadetta becomes an Imperial army general in the Crimson Flower path as well as in Azure Moon and Verdant Wind if she wasn't recruited.</p>
                            <p>In the Silver Snow route as well as Azure Moon and Verdant Wind if she was recruited, she will return home to live in seclusion before the day of promise.</p>

                            <p>If the Black Eagles route is chosen, in Imperial Year 1185, Bernadetta is assigned to the Black Eagle Strike Force at Garreg Mach.</p>
                            <p>If the Blue Lions or Golden Deer route is chosen and Bernadetta has not been drafted into the player's army, she will appear alongside her allies from the Black Eagles during Chapter 17, "Blood of the Eagle and Lion" where she may be killed during the 3-way onslaught between the three houses. Edelgard will mourn for her sacrifice if she does, saying that it will "not be in vain".</p>
                            <p>If she is recruited into the Golden Deer, after Enbarr is taken, she is happy that the Empire is out of the war but scared because Edelgard was the one who put her father under house arrest.</p>
