                <h1>Edelgard's Childhood</h1>
                <div class="blocoHorizontal">

                    <div class="textoMassa">
                        <p>Born in Imperial Year 1162, Edelgard is the ninth child of Emperor Ionius IX, the princess and heir to the Adrestian Empire, and a student at the Officers Academy in Garreg Mach Monastery. She is also the house leader of the Black Eagles.</p>
                        <p>In Imperial Year 1171, at the age of 9, she was taken by her uncle, Lord Volkhard von Arundel, to Fhirdiad in the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus during the Insurrection of the Seven. Volkhard was one of the key conspirators against Edelgard's father, and with his help, Duke Aegir stripped the emperor of much of his power. Unbeknownst to Volkhard or Edelgard, her mother had also escaped to Faerghus under the alias Patricia and married King Lambert.</p>
                        <p>She later met and befriended Dimitri, the crown prince of Faerghus, though he did not learn that she was his step-sister until years afterward. The two spent much time together, with Edelgard teaching him how to dance. Edelgard returned to the Empire in 1174 with her uncle, never learning that her mother was Dimitri's step-mother. Before she departed, Dimitri gifted her a dagger, which she has held onto since despite forgetting how she obtained it.</p>

                            <p>Edelgard's childhood afterward was much more traumatic. Upon her return to the Empire, she soon found that her father had been reduced to nothing more than a political puppet. Alongside her ten siblings, she was subjected to painful Crest experiments by Those Who Slither in the Dark with the support of the Adrestian nobles. Though her father objected, he could do nothing to stop them. As a result, most of her siblings were driven mad from the experiments or died from exhaustion.</p>
                            <p>By the end of it all, only Edelgard was able to survive and retain her sanity, leaving her as the only successful subject (which was possible because of the previous experiments conducted on Lysithea). As a result, she bore a second Crest, the Crest of Flames, at the cost of her hair turning white and her lifespan drastically shortened. These events would forever color her view of Crests, the Church of Seiros, and the caste system of Fódlan.</p>
                            <p>Edelgard never learned that her presence in Faerghus was used by Cornelia to manipulate Patricia and eventually cause the Tragedy of Duscur in Imperial Year 1176.</p>

                        <p>In 1180, she arrived at Garreg Mach Monastery to complete her education, and was resolved to reclaim what her father had lost. Her admittance marked the first time in ages since a member of the Hresvelg family sent a member to the Officer's Academy. She would soon become the House Leader of the Black Eagles.</p>

                            <p>Sometime before meeting Byleth, Edelgard took on the guise of the Flame Emperor. The suit used Agarthan technology to heavily distort her voice to protect her true identity. As the Flame Emperor, she employed bandits led by Kostas in an effort to kill as many students as possible during a training exercise --among them Claude and Dimitri. However, this endeavor failed due to Byleth's and Jeralt's intervention. After being saved by Byleth, she came to hold interest towards them while also staying cautious. She formed an alliance of convenience with Those Who Slither in the Dark, as they both oppose the church, though she despises them for their callous attitude towards collateral damage. During the attack on Remire Village, as the Flame Emperor, she encounters Byleth and Jeralt and offers an alliance. When Byleth refuses, the Emperor had expected the reaction but warns about their decisions in the future. Should Byleth accept, the Emperor will accuse them of lying.</p>
                            <p>Within the school year, she asks the students of the Officers Academy to hold a reunion five years later on the eve of the monastery's millennium festival. Eventually, she convinces Ionius IX to abdicate and assumes the Adrestian throne, an event Byleth can witness if they are her professor.</p>
                            <p>Eventually she orders Metodey and several soldiers to infiltrate the Holy Tomb. Should Byleth teach the Black Eagles, Edelgard accompanies her fellow classmates into the Holy Tomb. After Byleth sits on the throne, Metodey and several Imperial soldiers arrive, intending to pillage the Crest Stones. When Ferdinand remarks that Metodey must be working with the Flame Emperor, Linhardt immediately deduces that the Empire must be linked to it, prompting Bernadetta to ask Edelgard if she had any knowledge of the event. Edelgard confirms her suspicions and reveals her identity as the Flame Emperor, much to her classmates' shock. She tells her friends to stand down as the Imperial Army loot the Crest Stones, ordering her soldiers to kill them should they resist.</p>
                            <p>If Byleth taught the Blue Lions or Golden Deer however, she appears with Metodey in her Flame Emperor persona, and her true identity is revealed following the battle.</p>
                            <p>Rhea then orders Byleth to kill Edelgard, seeing her as a threat to Fódlan. If Byleth taught the other Houses or did not attend her coronation, they immediately side with Rhea, but Hubert comes in and takes her to safety before they can do anything. Should Byleth attend Edelgard's coronation, they have the option of siding with her; should they do so, Edelgard will be shocked, but grateful for their decision.</p>
                            <p>Upon returning to the Empire, Edelgard immediately declares war on the Church, organizing her forces to launch an attack on Garreg Mach, knowing that she would have the advantage if she could capture Rhea. If Byleth sided against her, the first assault fails, but a second assault results in Rhea's capture. If Byleth sided with her, the first assault is successful, though Rhea is able to escape, much to Edelgard's disappointment.</p>

                <h2>Edelgard Post-timeskip</h2>
                <div class="blocoHorizontal">

                            <p>Edelgard organized her former classmates into an elite task force known as the Black Eagle Strike Force. They are able to overwhelm the Church's forces, but in the aftermath of the battle, Rhea transforms into the Immaculate One and encases Byleth in rubble, sending them into a coma. Despite her efforts, Edelgard and the others are unable to find Byleth, and she is wracked with guilt over their supposed death.</p>
                            <p>After the Battle of Garreg Mach, Archbishop Rhea takes refuge in Fhirdiad. Garreg Mach falls into ruin, but Edelgard and the rest of the Imperial Army soon rehabilitate the former monastery and put it back into a running state, using it as their base of operations. She and the rest of her classmates spend the next five years in conflict with both the Kingdom and Church; the Alliance remained a neutral party, having people both for and against the Empire's actions.</p>
                            <p>Eventually, Byleth returns in Imperial Year 1185 on the day that would have been the Millennium Festival. Byleth encounters Edelgard upon returning to Garreg Mach, where she is surprised with their reappearance and shares a hug with them. After bringing them up to speed, she reintroduces Byleth to their former classmates, all of whom are happy with their return. With Byleth's aid, Edelgard is swiftly able to conquer Leicester, eventually defeating Claude and his forces at Derdriu. Edelgard and Byleth had the decision to spare or execute Claude. She was surprised that Claude had considered all possibilities after the battle. If Claude was spared, he decided to meet Edelgard one more time, and asked her to take care of his former classmates and bring peace to Fódlan, which she agreed to.</p>
                            <p>Following the absorption of the Alliance, the Knights of Seiros then perform a sneak attack on Garreg Mach to recapture it. While Rhea and Catherine distract most of the enemy forces, an expeditionary force led by Seteth attempt to sneak in, but are discovered by Edelgard and her strike force. They are quickly repelled, and the Church retreats following their defeat. However, both Randolph and Ladislava are killed during the battle with the main army, along with numerous other casualties. Despite the losses, Edelgard continues her campaign against the Church, planning an attack on Fhirdiad, although she informs Byleth they are taking a short detour to Arianrhod first.</p>
                            <p>The reason for attacking Arianrhod is because Cornelia is actually a member of those who slither in the dark. The siege is a success, with Arianrhod captured and Cornelia killed. However, in response for killing Cornelia, her uncle sends javelins of light to flatten the city. Though Hubert is concerned they acted rashly in killing Cornelia, Edelgard reassures him, stating that they forced those who slither in the dark to reveal their secret weapon. Hubert advises her to keep the truth of the incident away from the others, which she complies with, telling her classmates that the Church was responsible for flattening Arianrhod, and that they must end the war quickly before they can use the javelins of light again.</p>
                            <p>However, news of an Almyran army at Fódlan's Throat forces Edelgard to take her strike force there and defend the fortress as no other units can be spared. Edelgard defeats Nader, the enemy commander, forcing the Almyrans to retreat. Duke Goneril then entrusts Edelgard to protect the fortress, and she stations a group of soldiers there to defend it.</p>
                            <p>Now heading to the Tailtean Plains, Dimitri intercepts the Imperial Army, while waiting for Rhea's forces to arrive as they are late due to poor weather. In the ensuing battle, Dimitri is defeated and Rhea's forces are routed. If Dedue was defeated after turning into a Demonic Beast, Dimitri curses Edelgard, accusing her of causing immense suffering, but Edelgard ignores his accusations and executes him herself. Following the aftermath of the battle, Edelgard expresses surprise with Rhea's tactical skills, and somewhat mourns Dimitri's death, since her uncle was responsible for warping him into nothing more than a vengeful king.</p>
                            <p>The group finally arrives in Fhirdiad. Edelgard orders the Church to surrender and be spared. The Church does not respond, prompting Hubert to state that they should attack. The group then hears a roar as Rhea transforms into the Immaculate One, and a soldier comes in informing them that fires have sprung all over the city, much to Edelgard's disgust. She assembles the Black Eagle Strike Force and tells them not to die so they could all see the future she plans to bring at war's end. Edelgard, Byleth, and the Black Eagle Strike Force engage her in battle. Ultimately, the Empire emerges victorious and Rhea is slain. Following Rhea's death, Byleth collapses and apparently dies due to the strain of their Crest, much to Edelgard's initial horror. However, the Crest soon dissipates and their heart starts beating again, much to her delight.</p>
                            <p>With all of Fódlan under Adrestia's dominion, Edelgard finally begins the reforms she always wanted to bring to the nobility and the Crest system and begins a silent war against "those who slither in the dark", which is successful.</p>
