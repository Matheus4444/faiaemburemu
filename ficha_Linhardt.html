                        <p>Linhardt is the eldest son and heir of House Hevring, a line of counts. He has been good friends with Caspar since he was 6 years old.</p>

                        <p>Linhardt enrolls in the Garreg Mach Monastery Officers Academy in Imperial Year 1180 and joins the Black Eagles.</p>

                            <p>When the Black Eagles are taken to the Holy Tomb underneath Garreg Mach, Linhardt is fascinated that such a place existed underneath the monastery; in fact, during the War phase, he would often explore the tomb during his free time, as shown in his supports with Edelgard. When the Imperial Army, led by Metodey, arrives to plunder the tomb, Ferdinand suspects that he works for the Flame Emperor, prompting Linhardt to state that he did not expect the Imperial Army to be connected to the Flame Emperor.</p>
                            <p>Linhardt is the other Black Eagle member besides Edelgard in the party that explores Abyss. He revels in the chance to explore Abyss's library, which contains knowledge not available in Garreg Mach's official library, and serves as a de facto researcher of the Chalice of Beginnings and the Four Apostles.</p>

                            <p>Should Byleth support Edelgard, Linhardt will join the Black Eagle Strike Force. He states that he decided to join simply because he knew it would be pointless to fight against her.</p>
                            <p>Following the five-year timeskip, Linhardt will reveal to Byleth that he has occupied Hanneman's former room if he wasn't recruited during the Academy phase.</p>
