                        <p>Ferdinand is the eldest son and heir of House Aegir, which has held the office of prime minister of the Adrestian Empire for centuries. When he was 9 years old, his father, Ludwig, seized power in the Insurrection of the Seven, rendering Emperor Ionius IX politically impotent. He is very proud of his family's status as high-class nobility, but clashes with his father about what nobility actually is and means.</p>

                            <p>Sometime in his past, a young Ferdinand walked into a girl his age taking a bath in a nearby fountain. He was fascinated by the sight, almost believing her to be a water spirit, but felt so awkward that he couldn't speak to her and left to calm down. But when he returned to properly address her, the girl was already gone. Only years later he'd find out her identity to be his Black Eagles classmate, Dorothea.</p>
                            <p>His family also considered engaging him and another young noblewoman to marry, but he refused to go through it because the girl never left her room to greet him and there were rumors about her making dolls to curse her enemies. Said noblewoman was his also Black Eagles classmate, Bernadetta.</p>

                            <p>After finishing his studies, Ferdinand becomes an Imperial army general while his father's Dukedom is abolished and forfeited to the Empire.</p>
                            <p>Should Byleth not choose to teach the Black Eagles, and recruited Ferdinand to the Blue Lions or Golden Deer houses, Ferdinand will flee the Empire with several of his subordinates, leading a life of wandering for several years before returning to either the Kingdom or Alliance forces at Garreg Mach in Imperial Year 1185.</p>

                            <p>If the Black Eagles route is chosen, Ferdinand remains with his classmates, believing himself to be the only one capable of guiding Edelgard. Following Edelgard's coronation, she immediately dismisses Ludwig and places him under house arrest. Ferdinand soon succeeds him as the new Duke Aegir (and thus Prime Minister), though he is plagued with worry; as much as he dislikes his father, he admits that he has done considerable service for the Empire, and wonders if he should follow her into battle.</p>
